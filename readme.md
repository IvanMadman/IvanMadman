# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Ivan

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate programmer with roots dating back to my childhood days with the Commodore 64, I can still remember how futuristic it seemed to me and how old that makes me feel now😅. \
I started my journey with BASIC (I have to admit I used GOTO a lot, dont hate me cause I know I'm guilty enough) when I was just a curious kid under 10, and that spark never stopped since I earned my diploma in Computer Science 2 decades ago. \

Oooooh cmon I want to be honest here!!! \
I used GPT to suggest me a good profile bio and it was a nicely written one, probably better than this🤣. I then decided to be less verbose, less perfect but more me and i'm updating everything.
My first serious approach has been with C++ and Java, I worked for some years on personal web projects related to Phreaking (when 56k modem was still the best technology), dll injection/hooking, Unix shells, Ruby scripts, then I moved on servers (IIS - Apache), CMS and all related web file formats/languages. I'll never forget when I moved from Asp to Php, I personally felt in love at first sight with the second.
Right now I'm concentrating on honing my Python skills with a focus on Pytorch and Tensorflow, I'm not even sure how many virtual environments I've created and how many LLMs and Latent Models I've tried but I know there's always another one to study, some possible fine-tuning, some new algorithms to check and a future I cant wait to see. \

And now let's DELVE!! (ok, now you can hate me😂)
