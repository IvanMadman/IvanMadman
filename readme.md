# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Ivan

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate programmer with roots dating back to my childhood days with the Commodore 64. My journey in the world of coding began with BASIC when I was just a curious kid under 10, and that spark has turned into a roaring flame over the past two decades since earning my diploma in Computer Science.

## 💻 My Coding Journey
- **The Early Days**: C64 and BASIC - where it all began, before I was even 10!
- **Teenage Exploration**: By 15, I was diving into Unix shells and the TCP/IP protocol, opening up a whole new world of possibilities
- **Academic Years**: Graduated from High School as a Computer Science expert about 20 years ago
- **Professional Growth**: Never stopped learning and exploring new technologies

## 🌐 From BASIC to TCP/IP
My early fascination with the Commodore 64 and BASIC laid the foundation, but it was my teenage exploration of Unix shells and the TCP/IP protocol that truly opened my eyes to the vast potential of networking and system architecture. This early exposure shaped my understanding of how computers communicate and work together, influencing my approach to programming ever since.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
Here's a glimpse of the technologies I've embraced over the years:
